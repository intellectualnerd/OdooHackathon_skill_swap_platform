Skill Swap Platform is a mini app where users list skills they offer and want in return. Users can manage profiles, set availability, send/accept swap requests, and give feedback. Admins moderate content, manage users, track swaps, and send platform-wide messages. A peer-to-peer space to connect and grow.
